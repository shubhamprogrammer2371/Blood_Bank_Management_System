# Blood_Bank_Management_System

I've made a small Advanced Java Project in my SY-BCS semester 4 named 'Blood Bank
Management System'.
It was an individual project assigned to all students by our respective subject faculty.
Technologies used was Java Servlet and Java Server Pages(JSP) along with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).
In this project,user can
request for blood by providing it's details
like(name,emailid,phonenumber and blood 
group whichever he want).
I've made an admin
section where admin can see and manage the list of Blood Donors and Requests for Bloods.
By providing correct username and 
password admin can access the details.

Admin can
perform the following tasks:-
1) Can see the requests for blood.
2) Entertain the request or delete it.
3) Add details of Donor manually.
4) Update details of Donor manually.
5) Update the stock of blood group as per units.
6) Logout from the admin dashboard.

It was a small and very interesting project.
This project helped me in gaining an experience and application of Java Servlet and Java Server Pages(JSP) .
